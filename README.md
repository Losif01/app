# Streamlit GUI 
 The user interface for this application is built with Streamlit. It provides an intuitive way to interact with the image colorization system.

## Key Features:

### 1 -Title and Description:

     The app starts with a title (st.title("Image Colorization")) and description to inform the user about its purpose.

### 2 -File Upload:

     Users can upload their images in JPEG, JPG, or PNG formats using the st.file_uploader() widget. This triggers the preprocessing and inference steps.

### 3 -Image Display:

     The original and colorized images are displayed side-by-side using st.image() with captions for clarity.

### 4 -Dynamic Updates:

     The app processes and updates outputs dynamically as the user interacts with it.

## Benefits:
- User Friendly:  No coding knowledge is required to use the app.
- Real Time Feedback :  Users can see the results immediately after uploading an image.
- Customizable: The Streamlit widgets make it easy to add new features or modify existing ones.
